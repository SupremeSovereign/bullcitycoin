What is BullcityCoin?

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Bullcitycoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is also the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the client software, see http://www.bullcitycoins.com
